### 1. Install Prerequisites

The Deliverator package depends on gscam for camera usage. If gscam isn't available for your current ROS version, clone it to your [catkin workspace](http://wiki.ros.org/catkin/workspaces) and build it manually:

```shell
cd src
git clone https://github.com/ros-drivers/gscam.git
rosdep update --from-path . --ignore-src
catkin_make
```

gscam doesn't fully install all dependencies. gscam may fail at runtime if the following package isn't installed:

```shell
sudo apt-get install gstreamer0.10-plugins-good
```

### 2. Clone Repositories

Clone the deliverator repository into your catkin workspace. The suggested location is `~/catkin_ws/src/`, but any valid catkin worskspace source folder will work.

```git clone https://github.com/juztamau5/deliverator.git```

### 3. Install ROS Dependencies

Within the catkin workspace folder, run this command to install the packages this project depends on.

```rosdep install --from-path src --ignore-src -y```

### 3. Compilation & Running

To compile and install run `catkin_make` from the catkin workspace folder.

_Note:_ If you are unfamiliar with catkin, please know that you must run `source <catkin_ws>/devel/setup.sh` before ROS will be able to locate the deliverator packages. This line can be added to your ~/.bashrc file.

### 5. Test Setup in Simulation

To test that your setup process was successful, run the simulator with the following command:

```roslaunch deliverator_gazebo gazeboSim.launch```
