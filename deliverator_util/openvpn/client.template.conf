# Problem: bug in OpenVPN doesn't give an IP address to tap interface.
#
# Solution: we explicitly run dhclient from a shell script while pausing
# OpenVPN execution.

# Pause for enough time to open a terminal window and run dhclient. After this
# OpenVPN initialization continues with adding routes.

# Added down-pre so that the down script can be ran BEFORE the tap0 is closed.
# Initially the down script was running after the tap0 was destroyed and
# causing errors. This way "/etc/resolv.conf" is set back to what it
# previously was.

# This calls "dhclient -r" to release the IP back to the pool gracefully.
